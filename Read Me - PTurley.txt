Still recovering from the file format change introduced on 3-22-20.  CSV files prior to this date had 8 columns. Not only were 4 additional columns added but in a different order. This created numerous problems that took about two days to discover and remedy.
The Case Details query now appends two queries: one for existing files from Jan 22 through Mar 21 and the other for newer files added after 3-21.  In early testing, these changes worked and data loads correctly.

Moved the unmaintained files into an Archive folder.  These are reference and will probably not refresh with significant changes.

Big overhaul of the source queries - GitHub changed their site structure so changes were required to use Web.Contents() in queries that once depended on HTML <table> tags which were replaced with <div> tags (that's the simple story anyway).
